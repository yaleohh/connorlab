                    <br><br> In addition, the alarming increased incidence of neurologic, psychiatric, and non-communicable diseases (NCDs) later in life raises questions about the origins of these disorders and the factors operating in early life that

                    <br><br> To prevent suboptimal development in early life and poor health across the lifecourse, we need to understand how the health of the mother and malnutrition (in all its forms) set the developmental path of the child. We also

                    <p>
                        Maternal malnutrition (under- and overnutrition) can induce inflammation throughout the body. If these pro-inflammatory factors target intrauterine tissues, they may hinder the ability of these tissues to protect against microbes commonly associated with
                        the onset of preterm labour and other adverse pregnancy outcomes. Pro-inflammatory factors may also interfere with the transport of nutrients and other molecules to the fetus that are critical for its development. We are investigating
                        how maternal malnutrition and inflammatory states influence placental defence and transport. These studies are part of our larger goals to understand how early life environments influence risk for preterm birth and poor fetal development,
                        especially the brain, and to develop dietary interventions to prevent these adverse outcomes.

                        Gut bacteria have been linked to human health and disease states including obesity, diabetes, and brain disorders such as depression, anxiety and schizophrenia. We are investigating how common adverse conditions during pregnancy (maternal malnutrition,
                        obesity and maternal prenatal stress) impact the integrity of the maternal and offspring intestinal barriers and the composition and function of their gut microbiomes. These studies are part of our larger goal to understand how
                        the gut plays a role in coordinating exogenous signals from our environment (nutrition, stress), and endogenous signals in our bodies (pro-inflammatory and metabolic factors), to influence maternal health and increase vulnerability
                        to metabolic and stress-associated diseases in offspring.

                        The increased rates of developmental delay, neurologic- and stress-related disorders in later life raise questions about their origins. Early life environments can influence brain development in utero and postnatally. Malnourished and preterm infants
                        have impaired cognitive function and may have delayed gut maturation. We are investigating how maternal malnutrition impacts offspring brain development and function and how these changes may be linked to gut function. These studies
                        are part of our larger goals to understand the mechanisms underlying suboptimal development in preterm and malnourished infants, and to improve brain development and function, potentially through interventions that target the gut.

                        <p>Elia’s research aims to understand how adverse conditions during pregnancy, including malnutrition and obesity, compromise placental function. Specifically, she is investigating the impact of these maternal conditions on placental
                            transport and defence mechanisms.

                            Marina's research links poor maternal health with later developmental compromise in offspring. She is particularly interested in how early life events influence brain development and function. She is also investigating the role of postnatal nutrition,
                            specifically components in breast milk, as a modifier of these relationships.

                            Sebastian’s research aims to understand how development and disease risk are shaped by the gut-brain axis. To do this he is investigating how maternal malnutrition permits, or prevents, the transfer of molecules via the gut to the developing offspring,
                            and is assessing the impact of this on offspring brain development and function.

                            Through the Ontario Birth Study, we aim to understand the role of the microbiome in shaping metabolic health and disease trajectories in mothers and their offspring. To do this we have developed the MATaDOR (Microbial Approaches Targeting Diabetes and
